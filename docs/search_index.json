One of the main things you will have to do in any R project or RAP project will be manipulating the data that you are using in order to get it into the format you require. One of the main packages used to manipulate data is the dplyr package which we recommend and use throughout this book. Dplyr code functions can be combined and layered using the pipe operator %&gt;%. Dplyr is built to work with tidy data. To find out more about tidy data please look at the following link https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html but the general principles are: Each variables must have its own column Each observation must have its own row Each value must have its own cell 5.1 Pivot and reshape tables There will be two examples for pivoting tables provided: The tidyr package uses the gather/spread functions and is often used to create tidy data The reshape2 package is also a useful package to pivot tables and has added functionality such as providing totals of columns etc. We want to have the day of the week variable running along the top so each day of the week is its own table. Table 5.1: Number of road accidents by accident severity and weekday Accident_Severity Day_of_Week n 1 1 300 1 2 205 1 3 187 1 4 233 1 5 220 1 6 250 Tidyr package Using the tidyr package, gather and spread functions can be used to pivot the table views: gather makes wide data longer i.e. variables running along the top can be “gathered” into rows running down. spread makes long data wider i.e. one variable can be spread and run along the top with each value being a variable. # Pivot table using tidyr package library(tidyr) road_accidents_weekdays &lt;- road_accidents_small %&gt;% tidyr::spread(Day_of_Week, n) With the spread function above you need to first specify the variable you want to spread, in this case Day_of_Week, and then the variable that will be used to populate the columns (n). Table 5.2: Number of road accidents by accident severity and weekday, tidyr::spread Accident_Severity 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 300 205 187 233 220 250 281 2 3009 2948 3230 3227 3246 3649 3225 3 11668 14783 16065 15859 16331 17346 13720 The opposite can also be done using the gather function: GET HELP ON THIS # Pivot table using tidyr package library(tidyr) road_accidents_gather &lt;- road_accidents_weekdays %&gt;% tidyr::gather(Accident_Severity, n, 1:7) Reshape2 package Again, this has two functions which can be used to pivot tables: melt makes wide data longer dcast makes long data wider # Pivot table using reshape2 package library(reshape2) road_accidents_weekdays2 &lt;- reshape2::dcast(road_accidents_small, Accident_Severity ~ Day_of_Week, value.var = &quot;n&quot;) With the dcast function above you need to first specify the variable(s) you want in long format (multiple variables seperated by “+”), in this case Accident_Severity, and then the wide format variable(s) are put after the tilda (again multiple seperated by “+”). The value.var argument specifices which column will be used to populate the new columns, in this case it is n. Table 5.3: Number of road accidents by accident severity and weekday, reshape2::dcast Accident_Severity 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 300 205 187 233 220 250 281 2 3009 2948 3230 3227 3246 3649 3225 3 11668 14783 16065 15859 16331 17346 13720 If you want to create sums and totals of the tables this can also be done using reshape2. For example, taking the original table, we want to pivot it and sum each severity to get the total number of accidents per day. # Pivot table using reshape2 package library(reshape2) road_accidents_weekdays3 &lt;- reshape2::dcast(road_accidents_small, Accident_Severity ~ Day_of_Week, value.var = &quot;n&quot;, sum, margins = &quot;Accident_Severity&quot;) In this example, we use the margins argument to specify what we want to combine to create totals. So we want to add all the accident severity figures up for each weekday. Before using margin you need to specify how the margins are calculated, in this case we want a sum. Alternative options are to calculate the length, i.e. the number of rows. Table 5.4: Number of road accidents by accident severity and weekday plus totals, reshape2::dcast Accident_Severity 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 300 205 187 233 220 250 281 2 3009 2948 3230 3227 3246 3649 3225 3 11668 14783 16065 15859 16331 17346 13720 (all) 14977 17936 19482 19319 19797 21245 17226 The opposite can also be done using the melt function. # Pivot table using reshape2 package library(reshape2) road_accidents_melt &lt;- reshape2::melt(road_accidents_weekdays2, id.vars = &quot;Accident_Severity&quot;, measure.vars = c(&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;4&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, &quot;6&quot;, &quot;7&quot;), variable.name = &quot;Day_of_Week&quot;, value.name = &quot;n&quot;) For the melt function you need to specify: id.vars = “variables to be kept as columns” measure.vars = c(“variables to be created as one column”) variable.name = “name of created column using the measure.vars” value.name = “name of value column” Table 5.5: Number of road accidents by accident severity and weekday, reshape2::melt Accident_Severity Day_of_Week n 1 1 300 2 1 3009 3 1 11668 1 2 205 2 2 2948 3 2 14783 5.2 Dropping and selecting columns Use the dplyr select function to both select and drop columns. Select columns road_accidents_4_cols &lt;- road_accidents %&gt;% dplyr::select(acc_index, Accident_Severity, Date, Police_Force) Table 5.6: Four columns from road accidents 2017 acc_index Accident_Severity Date Police_Force 2017010001708 1 2017-08-05 1 2017010009342 3 2017-01-01 1 2017010009344 3 2017-01-01 1 2017010009348 3 2017-01-01 1 2017010009350 2 2017-01-01 1 2017010009351 3 2017-01-01 1 Drop columns Note that to drop columns the difference is putting a “-” in front of the variable name. road_accidents_3_cols &lt;- road_accidents_4_cols %&gt;% dplyr::select(-Police_Force) Table 5.7: Three columns from road accidents 2017 acc_index Accident_Severity Date 2017010001708 1 2017-08-05 2017010009342 3 2017-01-01 2017010009344 3 2017-01-01 2017010009348 3 2017-01-01 2017010009350 2 2017-01-01 2017010009351 3 2017-01-01 5.3 Filtering data Use the dplyr filter function to filter data. This example filters the data for slight severity accidents (accident severity 3). road_accidents_slight &lt;- road_accidents_4_cols %&gt;% dplyr::filter(Accident_Severity == 3) Table 5.8: Slight severity road accidents 2017 acc_index Accident_Severity Date Police_Force 2017010009342 3 2017-01-01 1 2017010009344 3 2017-01-01 1 2017010009348 3 2017-01-01 1 2017010009351 3 2017-01-01 1 2017010009353 3 2017-01-01 1 2017010009354 3 2017-01-01 1 To filter multiple conditions: And operator road_accidents_filter &lt;- road_accidents_4_cols %&gt;% dplyr::filter(Accident_Severity == 3 &amp; Police_Force == 4) Or operator road_accidents_filter2 &lt;- road_accidents_4_cols %&gt;% dplyr::filter(Accident_Severity == 3 | Accident_Severity == 2) Note: filtering with characters must be wrapped in “quotations” e.g: road_accidents_filter3 &lt;- road_accidents %&gt;% dplyr::filter(`Local_Authority_(Highway)` == &quot;E09000010&quot;) Also note that in the above example the variable is quoted in back ticks (`). This is because some variable names confuse R due to brackets and numbers and need to be wrapped in back ticks so R knows that everything inside the back ticks is a variable name. 5.4 Get counts of data To get counts for groups of data, the dplyr tally function can be used in conjunction with the dplyr group by function. This groups the data into the required groups and then tallys how many records are in each group. # Create grouped data set with counts road_accidents_small &lt;- road_accidents %&gt;% dplyr::group_by(Accident_Severity, Day_of_Week) %&gt;% dplyr::tally() The above example creates groups by accident severity and weekday and counts how many accidents are in each group (one row equals one accident therefore the tally is counting accidents). Table 5.9: Road accidents 2017 by accident severity and weekday Accident_Severity Day_of_Week n 1 1 300 1 2 205 1 3 187 1 4 233 1 5 220 1 6 250 5.5 Combine tables When combining data from two tables there are two ways to do this in R: Bind the tables by basically either appending the tables on the rows or columns Join the tables using the dplyr version of SQL joins Binding tables Binding tables is mainly done to append tables by creating more rows, however tables can also be binded by adding more columns. Although it is recommended to use the dplyr join functions to combine columns (see 5.6). Here are three tables, one shows data for accident severity of 1, one for accident severity of 2, and one for accident severity of 3. Table 5.10: Number of fatal road accidents in 2017, by weekday Accident_Severity Day_of_Week n 1 1 300 1 2 205 1 3 187 1 4 233 1 5 220 1 6 250 1 7 281 Table 5.10: Number of serious injury road accidents in 2017, by weekday Accident_Severity Day_of_Week n 2 1 3009 2 2 2948 2 3 3230 2 4 3227 2 5 3246 2 6 3649 2 7 3225 Table 5.10: Number of slight injury road accidents in 2017, by weekday Accident_Severity Day_of_Week n 3 1 11668 3 2 14783 3 3 16065 3 4 15859 3 5 16331 3 6 17346 3 7 13720 To combine these tables we can use the bind_rows function from the dplyr package. Use bind_rows when you want to append the tables underneath one another to make one longer table, i.e. you want to add more rows. Ensure that the column names for each table are exactly the same in each table. # combine tables using bind_rows library(dplyr) all_accidents &lt;- accidents_1 %&gt;% dplyr::bind_rows(accidents_2, accidents_3) Table 5.11: Road accident data 2017, bind_rows Accident_Severity Day_of_Week n 1 1 300 1 2 205 1 3 187 1 4 233 1 5 220 1 6 250 1 7 281 2 1 3009 2 2 2948 2 3 3230 2 4 3227 2 5 3246 2 6 3649 2 7 3225 3 1 11668 3 2 14783 3 3 16065 3 4 15859 3 5 16331 3 6 17346 3 7 13720 5.6 Joining tables Joins in R can be done using dplyr. This is generally to combine columns of data from two tables: # combine tables using left join library(dplyr) all_accidents_cols_join &lt;- road_acc_1 %&gt;% dplyr::left_join(road_acc_2, by = &quot;acc_index&quot;) This uses the same principles as SQL, by specifying what the tables should be joined on using the by = argument. Table 5.12: Road accident data 2017, left join acc_index Police_Force Accident_Severity Date Day_of_Week 2017010001708 1 1 2017-08-05 7 2017010009342 1 3 2017-01-01 1 2017010009344 1 3 2017-01-01 1 2017010009348 1 3 2017-01-01 1 2017010009350 1 2 2017-01-01 1 2017010009351 1 3 2017-01-01 1 Dplyr has all the usual SQL joins for example, inner_join, full_join, right_join. All of these are used in the same way as the left join example above. Another useful join for data manipulation is an anti_join. This provides all the data that is not in the joined table. For example, the below snapshot of a table displays road accident totals broken down by accident severity and weekday: Accident_Severity Day_of_Week n 1 1 300 1 2 205 1 3 187 1 4 233 1 5 220 1 6 250 I am interested in creating two sub-groups of this data, a table for all accidents on a Monday (weekday 2), and all other accidents. First, I get the Monday data using the dplyr filter function (see 5.3). Accident_Severity Day_of_Week n 1 2 205 2 2 2948 3 2 14783 Then, I can use an anti-join to create a table which has all of the data that is not in the above table: # create table of all rows not in the joined table library(dplyr) all_accidents_not_monday &lt;- road_accidents_small %&gt;% dplyr::anti_join(accidents_monday, by = c(&quot;Accident_Severity&quot;, &quot;Day_of_Week&quot;)) The above code takes the initial table we want to get our data from (road_accidents_small) and anti joins accidents_monday. This says, “get all the rows from road_accidents_small that are not in accidents_monday”. Again, note the need to specify what the join rows would be joined and compared by. Table 5.13: Road accident data 2017 not on a Monday by accident severity Accident_Severity Day_of_Week n 1 1 300 1 3 187 1 4 233 1 5 220 1 6 250 1 7 281 2 1 3009 2 3 3230 2 4 3227 2 5 3246 2 6 3649 2 7 3225 3 1 11668 3 3 16065 3 4 15859 3 5 16331 3 6 17346 3 7 13720 5.7 Select specific columns in a join Doing a join with dplyr will join all columns from both tables, however sometimes not all columns from each table are needed. Let’s look at some previous tables again: Table 5.14: Police force and accident severity information for accidents acc_index Police_Force Accident_Severity 2017010001708 1 1 2017010009342 1 3 2017010009344 1 3 2017010009348 1 3 2017010009350 1 2 2017010009351 1 3 Table 5.14: Date and weekday information for accidents acc_index Date Day_of_Week 2017010001708 2017-08-05 7 2017010009342 2017-01-01 1 2017010009344 2017-01-01 1 2017010009348 2017-01-01 1 2017010009350 2017-01-01 1 2017010009351 2017-01-01 1 Let’s say we want acc_index and Police_Force from the first table, and Date from the second table. # select specific columns from each table and left join library(dplyr) road_acc_3 &lt;- road_acc_1 %&gt;% dplyr::select(acc_index, Police_Force) %&gt;% dplyr::left_join(select(road_acc_2, acc_index, Date), by = &quot;acc_index&quot;) The above code takes the first table and uses the select statement to select the required columns from the first table. Then within the left_join command, to select the data from the second table, you again add the select statement. Note: you will need to select the joining variable in both tables but this will only appear once Table 5.15: Police force and Date information for specific accidents acc_index Police_Force Date 2017010001708 1 2017-08-05 2017010009342 1 2017-01-01 2017010009344 1 2017-01-01 2017010009348 1 2017-01-01 2017010009350 1 2017-01-01 2017010009351 1 2017-01-01 5.8 Sum rows or columns These solutions use the base R functions rather than dplyr. 5.8.1 Sum rows To sum across a row: # sum across a row road_accidents_weekdays$rowsum &lt;- rowSums(road_accidents_weekdays, na.rm = TRUE) Table 5.16: Road accidents 2017 by accident severity and weekday Accident_Severity 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 rowsum 1 300 205 187 233 220 250 281 1677 2 3009 2948 3230 3227 3246 3649 3225 22536 3 11668 14783 16065 15859 16331 17346 13720 105775 To sum across specific rows: # sum across specific rows road_accidents_weekdays$alldays &lt;- road_accidents_weekdays$`1` + road_accidents_weekdays$`2`+ road_accidents_weekdays$`3`+ road_accidents_weekdays$`4`+ road_accidents_weekdays$`5`+ road_accidents_weekdays$`6`+ road_accidents_weekdays$`7` Table 5.17: Road accidents 2017 by accident severity and weekday Accident_Severity 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 alldays 1 300 205 187 233 220 250 281 1676 2 3009 2948 3230 3227 3246 3649 3225 22534 3 11668 14783 16065 15859 16331 17346 13720 105772 5.8.2 Sum columns To sum columns to get totals of each column, note this will appear as a console output not in a data object: # sum columns colSums(road_accidents_weekdays, na.rm = TRUE) To get the totals of each column as a row in the data: library (janitor) # create total column road_accidents_weekdays &lt;- road_accidents_weekdays %&gt;% janitor::adorn_totals(&quot;row&quot;) Table 5.18: Road accidents 2017 by accident severity and weekday Accident_Severity 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 300 205 187 233 220 250 281 2 3009 2948 3230 3227 3246 3649 3225 3 11668 14783 16065 15859 16331 17346 13720 Total 14977 17936 19482 19319 19797 21245 17226 Reshape2 can also be used to get column totals when pivoting a table (See 5.1). 5.9 Replace NAs or other values 5.10 Creating new variables 5.11 Summarising data 5.12 Look up tables "]
